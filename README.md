## Image-Classification-with-Flask-and-ResNet50

# Project Overview
This project is an image classification web application built using Flask and a pre-trained ResNet50 model from Keras. The application allows users to upload images and receive predictions about the content of those images.

# Technologies Used
1. Python: A programming language widely used for machine learning and web development.
2. Flask: A micro web framework for Python used to create web applications.
3. Keras: A high-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow.
4. ResNet50: A deep learning model used for image classification.
5. HTML: For creating the user interface.

# Features
1. Upload images for classification.
2. Displays the predicted label with confidence percentage.
3. User-friendly interface.
